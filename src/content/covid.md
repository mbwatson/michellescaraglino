# COVID-19 Updates

At Local Salon, we have implemented the following safety measures to protect our clients and our stylists.

## Local Salon Policies

*   Only one client per stylist at a time—please do not bring any guests or children. If you are someone who needs assistance with your appointment, you may have one person with you.
*   There is no longer a waiting area inside the salon. Upon arrival, please text your stylist to check-in and stay in your car until called to be let in.
*   If you (or anyone in your household) are experiencing any symptoms (fever, chills, sore throat, aches, or [any other symptoms else listed by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)), have been in contact with anyone sick, or are awaiting test results, then you will need to reschedule by email or phone.
*   Masks will be worn at all times by all people in the building. If you cannot procure a mask, you will be provided one at the door.
*   Follow your stylist to the chair, and stay seated unless directed otherwise.
*   Only one client is permitted in each of the shampoo and processing rooms at a time, and those seating areas are cleaned between guests.
*   Restroom use: Stylists and clients will wash their hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds.
*   Stylists will wash their hands between each client.

## My Policies

The above Local Salon COVID-19 policies have necessitated some changes to my services and the way my appointments will operate. In addition to the items listed below, please know that I am currently working on a limited schedule and will be until further notice.

## Services

*   I will not be offering any waxing services until further notice.
*   I will only be doing dry cuts, so please come with clean hair, dry to almost dry. Contact me for questions about individual appointments.
*   Blow dries with color services will be limited, and please let me know ahead of time if you would like one after your color service.

## Appointment

*   Appointments will be kept as brief as possible, without compromising services provided.
*   When you arrive, please sanitize your hands, and I will check your temperature. If it is 100°F or above, we will need to reschedule your apointment.
*   Limit the number of items brought in with you, I only have a small space for you to set a few small items - this is to keep track of areas to sanitize.
*   I prefer not to accept cash at this time, and will send a Square invoice while you're still in my chair.
*   If you're purchasing product, I will remove it from the shelf and provide it to you when you leave.

## What I'm Doing

While all of these policies are in place to protect clients and stylists inside Local Salon, I am implementing further measures. These measures include:

*   Disinfecting all of my tools and equipment between appointments, including the chair and any areas you might come into contact with
*   Utilizing a UV-C cabinet to sanitize my cutting implements
*   Utilizing a sanitized set of drawers to individually house towels, clips, and combs for each appointment
*   Wearing a clean apron for each client
*   Letting clients in and out of the building so you do not have to touch doorknobs
*   Wearing an N-95 comparable mask, and will be happy to wear a shield as well upon request
*   Practicing extreme precaution outside of work

If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to ask! Thank you for your consideration!
