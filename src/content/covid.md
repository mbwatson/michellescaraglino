# COVID-19 Updates

At Local Salon, we have implemented the following safety measures to protect our clients and our stylists.

## Local Salon Policies

*   Only one client per stylist at a time — please do not bring any guests or children. However, if you are someone who needs assistance with your appointment, you may have one person with you.
*   There is no longer a waiting area inside the salon. Upon arrival, please text your stylist to check-in and stay in your car until called to be let in.
*   If you (or anyone in your household) are experiencing any symptoms (fever, chills, sore throat, aches, or [any other symptoms else listed by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html)), have been in contact with anyone sick, or are awaiting test results, then you will need to reschedule by email, phone, or use <a href="/contact">my contact form.</a>.
*   Masks will be worn at all times by all people in the building. If you cannot procure a mask, you will be provided one at the door.
*   We will do our bests to have one client in each of the shampoo and processing rooms at a time, and those seating areas are cleaned between guests.
*   Restroom use: Stylists and clients will wash their hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds.
*   Stylists will wash their hands between each client.

## My Policies

The above Local Salon COVID-19 policies have necessitated some changes to my services and the way my appointments will operate. In addition to the items listed below, please know that I was vaccinated on 3/20/21 and am working on a limited schedule until further notice.

### Services

*   I will not be offering any waxing services until further notice.
*   Please arrive with clean hair (washed the day before is fine) for any service. Contact me for questions about individual appointments.
*   Color services will include a blow dry, unless you are not comfortable with it. I'll plan for it unless you let me know.

### Appointment

*   When you arrive, please sanitize your hands, and I will check your temperature. If it is 100°F or above, we will need to reschedule your appointment.
*   Please limit the number of items brought in with you, as I only have a small space for you to store a few small items: a hook for your coat and bag and a small table. Anything else will have to sit on the floor, but you're welcome to bring what you need.
*   PAYMENT: I have started using my Square chip reader for payment at the time of service — there is hand sanitizer available to use before and after signing my tablet, which is sanitized between uses. 


### What I'm Doing

While all of these policies are in place to protect clients and stylists inside Local Salon, I am implementing further measures. These measures include:

*   Disinfecting all of my tools and equipment between appointments, including the chair and any areas you might come into contact with
*   Utilizing a UV-C cabinet to sanitize my cutting implements
*   As always, you will be provided a clean cape, and sterilized combs and clips will be set out in a clean towel immediately before your appointment.
*   Wearing a clean apron for each client
*   Letting clients in and out of the building so you do not have to touch doorknobs
*   Wearing a 2-3 layer mask with a filter
*   Practicing extreme precaution outside of work

If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to ask! Thank you for your consideration!
