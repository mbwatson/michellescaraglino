# Hair

Hello, I’m Michelle Scaraglino! I entered the beauty industry in 2006 at the [Aveda Institute of Chapel Hill](https://aveda.edu/locations/location/chapel-hill-nc/), and I have worked as a hairdresser ever since. After working in commission-based salons for a few years, I ventured out on my own into a studio salon in 2013.After a few-year stint renting a chair in a space with a lovely group of people, I was ready to have my own space again. In 2022, I found my new home at [Mordecai Office Park](https://goo.gl/maps/rccB8q5VYTBbhKQQ8), where I have my own private studio. 

I'm passionate about helping people feel beautiful and confident, while making sure their hair works for their day-to-day lives and is not a source of stress. To me, hair is an accessory and can be such a source of empowerment and confidence.

Using cruelty-free and vegan color lines is very important to me. I'm so happy to have found a comprehensive color line that I love that meets these needs. I use [Pulp Riot](https://www.pulpriothair.com/) for all color services. This is a great, low-toxin color line - check out their [SkinSafe](https://www.skinsafeproducts.com/pulp-riot) ratings!

They have a handful of products that contain lanolin or honey, and will happily direct you to the products that do not.
*   I also use a handful of [Hairstory](https://www.hairstory.com/?r=300000052) products — not an entirely vegan line, by any means — but they do make some amazing styling products.
