# Hair

Hello, I’m Michelle Scaraglino! I entered the beauty industry in 2006 at the [Aveda Institute of Chapel Hill](https://aveda.edu/locations/location/chapel-hill-nc/), and I have worked as a hairdresser ever since. After working in commission-based salons for a few years, I ventured out on my own into a studio salon in 2013. Seven years later, I was ready for a change, and I've found my new home in a booth rent salon called [Local Salon](https://goo.gl/maps/TLMsf6wB1kjWYWYB8).

I’m passionate about helping people feel beautiful and confident, while making sure their hair works for their day-to-day lives and is not a source of stress. To me, hair is an accessory and can be such a source of empowerment and confidence.

Check out [my instagram](https://www.instagram.com/michellescaraglinohair) to see some of my work!

Using cruelty-free and vegan color lines, when possible, is very important to me. For permanent and semi-permanent colors, I use [Pulp Riot](https://www.pulpriothair.com/). This is a great, low-toxin color line - check out their [SkinSafe](https://www.skinsafeproducts.com/pulp-riot) ratings! I do continue to use a very small amount of [Redken Shades EQ](https://www.redken.com/blog/at-the-salon/shades-eq-demi-permanent-hair-gloss), but have almost completely replaced it with [Pulp Riot](https://www.pulpriothair.com/)'s brand new demi-permanent color line. (Woohoo!)

They have a handful of products that contain lanolin or honey, and will happily direct you to the products that do not.
*   I also use a handful of [Hairstory](https://www.hairstory.com/?r=300000052) products — not an entirely vegan line, by any means — but they do make some amazing styling products.
*   [Cult + King](https://cultandking.com/ref/michellescaraglino/) is an awesome boutique product line with all vegan, extremely clean products. They even have refillable packaging!
