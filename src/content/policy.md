# Cancellation & Late Policy

I understand that schedules can change and unexpected things happen. To ensure a smooth experience for everyone, please review the following policies regarding cancellations and late arrivals.

## Late Arrivals

If you arrive more than **15 minutes late**, your appointment will need to be rescheduled. While I'll do my best to accommodate you when possible, **50% of the original service cost** will be charged.

## Cancellations & Last-Minute Changes

Please provide at least **24 hours' notice** if you need to cancel or modify your appointment.

Cancellations made **less than 24 hours in advance** will incur a **50% charge of the scheduled service**. This also applies to same-day changes that reduce the length of your appointment (for example, shortening a 3-hour service to 1 hour), unless discussed and agreed upon during your appointment.

## Illness

If you or anyone in your household is feeling unwell, please stay home. Your health—and mine—comes first, and I'm always happy to reschedule once you're feeling better.

## Scheduling Changes

I make every effort to stay on schedule and will notify you promptly if I need to make any changes. If something urgent arises on your end, please reach out—I'm happy to work with you whenever possible.

## Payment

Any applicable cancellation or late fees will be processed via a payment link sent to you.

## Thank you!

Thank you for your understanding and for respecting both my time and yours.
