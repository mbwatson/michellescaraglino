  Every quarter, Michelle has edited my closet and created 5-6 outfits all the way down to the jewelry. I take photos and save them in Evernote to look at on Sundays when I create my outfits for the week. This has helped with the female penalty of decision-fatigue that comes about from deciding what to wear in the mornings. I have an image I want to portray as a professional speaker and Michelle helps me do it with ease."
