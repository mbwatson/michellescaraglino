# Styling

Since I was a teenager, I've used my clothing to express my personality. Our clothes are one of the ways we show the world who we are, whether we like it or not. I'm a firm believer that what you wear should make you feel good and feel like your best self, and in turn you'll be projecting the image you wish for others to see. Style is extremely personal; I don't take this for granted when someone allows me into their closet. I seek to help you feel comfortable in your own skin and confident in who you are through your clothes. Sometimes this just means tweaking the fit of an item, or having help accessorizing. I don't believe in cookie cutter style, and I do believe that all bodies are worthy and beautiful. For many people, it takes someone else's perspective for you to see yourself this way.

Proudly serving women/femme/nonbinary clients.

If you're interested in any of the following services, please contact me to schedule a virtual meeting and consultation. (All services will be virtual for the time being.)

## Wardrobe Editing

Having a second pair of eyes to help you rid your closet of items that no longer serve youâ€”poor fit, not your style, don't represent who you are, outdated, etc.

## Outfit Curating

Using what you have in your closetâ€”including shoes and accessoriesâ€”I help you create modern outfits that express your personality accurately and appropriately to meet your needs for work, public speaking, photo shoots, etc. A photo gallery will be kept for easy access to streamline your mornings/meetings/engagements. If desired, I'm happy to consult with you on your hairstyle/color suitability.

## Personal Shopping

Once a wardrobe edit and image consulting session have been done, we will establish if you are missing key pieces to make more well-rounded outfits that make you feel your best. If you don't want to shop for items yourself, we can add on a virtual shopping session where I curate some shopping carts/lists for you to pick through.

Because the fashion industry unfortunately is a major culprit of water and air pollution, as well as unethical working conditions around the globe, it's important to me to shop as ethically as possible, when possible... no one is perfect, of course ðŸ˜‰. For myself, this often means second-hand gems and specialty items from ethical clothing companies. (See a list of some of my favorite sites below!). If this resonates with you, I'll be excited to help you on that journey since I'm on it as well. Let me know what's important to you, of course, and we'll go from there!
