  I was preparing for a high stakes keynote presentation at the Savor Life Summit... and Michelle to the rescue. Using clothes and accessories already in my closet, Michelle made sure that my look was current and professional with a twist that increased my confidence and personal style. As I approached the main stage I heard attendees whispering, "Wow, love her look!" My appearance and look was a smash! Thank you, Michelle!
